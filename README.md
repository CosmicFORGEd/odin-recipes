# This is my first project
I will be writing HTML in this repo while also learning Git practically.

## Learning Plan
I will only be starting with HTML first, but soon will add CSS in the next few days.

## Recipes Added
I have uploaded 2 fully updated recipes with all related files and links to other sites to check out even more dishes:

1. **Taco Casserole**
   - Full tutorial video  
   - Basic info table  
   - Nutritional values table  
   - Links to other websites for full nutritional breakdown  

2. **Mexican Casserole**
   - Full tutorial video  
   - Basic info table  
   - In-detail nutritional values table (with dropdown option)  
   - Links to other websites for full nutritional breakdown and optional side dishes  

**PS: NAH, Iâ€™D WIN! ðŸ˜Ž**
